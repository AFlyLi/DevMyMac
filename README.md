### What This Does
> So basicly, when I do a fresh install of OSX, I always end up doing the same thing to set back up my workspace. I mainly program in Node.js, as you will see in whats installed! What this does is setup git, node.js, nvm, Zsh, A Good Few Programs and some command line tools! Any additions people want, or if anyone want to help out just __Fork it and throw a pull request__, I will get back to you ASAP


### Installation
First the XCODE command line tools must be installed, then the script can run!

1. Open Terminal
2. `xcode-select --install`
3. `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamisntdead/CleanMacSetup/master/setup.sh)"`
